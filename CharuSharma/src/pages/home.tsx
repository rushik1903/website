                    I'm an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://mll.iiit.ac.in/"><strong>Machine Learning Lab</strong></a> at International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H).
                    <br/><br/> As a PhD student, I have worked in <a href="https://krama.cse.iith.ac.in/index.html"><strong>Krama Lab</strong></a> under the guidance of <a href="https://manukaul.github.io/"><strong>Dr. Manohar Kaul</strong></a> in the department of Computer Science & Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad.
                    <br/> I completed my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence from University of Hyderabad under the guidance of Prof. Arun K. Pujari. Prior to this, I worked as a Junior Software Engineer under Prof. Deepak B. Phatak at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay.
                    My interests include Geometric Machine/ Deep Learning (graphs and point clouds), Topological Data Analysis.
